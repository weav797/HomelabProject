# HomelabProject
Hosting my docker compose script and other bash shell scripts I use on a day-to-day basis.

docker-compose.yml - Use this one script to virtualize 5 containers of what I use on a day-to-day basis. Plex, Immich, MakeMKV, Handbrake, and Portainer to graphically manage said containers

copy_PMS_Media and copy_PMS_Metadata.sh - Scripts are run automatically on a cron job every evening to make sure backups are a painless inconvenience!
